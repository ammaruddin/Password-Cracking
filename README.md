# Password Cracking Lab

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is strictly for educational and ethical hacking purposes and done under controlled environment. Unauthorized use of these techniques is illegal.


## Overview
This lab, conducted by **Mohammed Ammaruddin (am3033, 11652745)**, explores password vulnerabilities by simulating brute force attacks and analyzing common weak passwords. The primary objective is to demonstrate how attackers exploit poor password practices and highlight the importance of using strong, secure passwords.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the mechanics of brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Measure the time taken to crack passwords using different methods.
- Identify common weak passwords that are frequently exploited by attackers.

---

## Key Findings

### Q1: **Analysis**
- Specific details for this question are not included in the lab.

### Q2: **Time for the First Attack**
- It took approximately **14 minutes** to successfully execute the first attack.

### Q3: **Cracked Password**
- The password identified during the attack is: **ant**.

### Q4: **Analysis**
- Specific details for this question are not included in the lab.

### Q5: **Time for the Second Attack**
- The second attack was completed in approximately **9 minutes**.

### Q6: **Most Common Weak Passwords**
The following passwords were identified as common and vulnerable:
1. `123456`
2. `12345`
3. `123456789`
4. `password`
5. `iloveyou`

## Tools and Techniques
- **Tools Used**: (Specify the tool used, e.g., `John the Ripper`, `Hashcat`, or other tools).
- **Attack Types**: Brute force and dictionary-based attacks.
- **Password Source**: A sample password hash file was used for analysis.

---

## Insights
- Weak passwords such as `123456` and `password` are commonly exploited due to their simplicity and predictability.
- Time to crack depends on the hashing algorithm, password complexity, and attack method.
- These results underscore the need for strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.

---

## Recommendations
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid Common Passwords**: Refrain from using predictable passwords like those listed above.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security to protect accounts.
